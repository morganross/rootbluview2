List of Problems in order
The Center Justifyed formatting makes it impossible to distingush between titles and content.
The post begins witout complete sentences, and is unable to be decifered. It was made intentionaly deceitful, or the links have rotted.

The first main problem that causes is

"Recoveries" is followed by 2 words without verbs or a hyperlink. one of the words is formatted as a filename, but no file is referened.
"Roms" the second instriction is an ungoogleable abrivation followed by a "?". I expect the guide to provide answers, not questions

The "info" section referes a file, but the file is not in the post. The file discription includes referenece to a specific "the" something, but this is the first sentece, so referenfing something from the past is wrong.
